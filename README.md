### Project Title: 
HerStory: Timelines out of Domestic Violence

### Project Procedure: 
**Goal:**
Explore potential barriers and key moments in ending abusive relationships.  

**Description**

Using time as a key variable, I mapped out 6 stories from women who have left abusive relationships, either they have left their partner or their partner is no longer abusive.
I supported the timelines from quotes from each survivor to include the survivors' voices in this project as well as share stories. I felt that was especially important in a climate where survivor stories are often dismissed.


**Constraints**

My current access to domestic violence survivors is through the Jahajee Sisters, a grassroots organization in Queens working to end gender-based violence in the Indo-Caribbean community.  I have spoken to 8 survivors of domestic violence and 5 have agreed to collaborate with me on thesis.  Due to this, I have a very small sample size and limited dataset.  To really establish strong correlations, more research, data collection is required. This is especially challenging due to cultural stigma around speaking up.  Additionally, each each woman has unique needs, which can be influenced by factors like immigration status and socio-economic status, therefore a limited dataset makes it especially difficult to form insights around victims' needs.

**Hypothesis + Intention**

Through visualizing the stories of 6 survivors, I will be able to identify relationships between key moments and potential barriers towards ending an abusive relationship.

My thesis began very exploratory around the needs of women experiencing domestic violence in the Indo-Caribbeam community.   I spoke to several stakeholders from grassroots activists, precinct DV advocates, trauma therapists, and support groups. During my research, I found 5 Indo-Caribbean women who have agreed to co-create an intervention with me.  Since I have been working closely with them, I have gotten to know their stories very well. I thought my final project for data visualization could be an opportunity to visualize their stories.

This would also be an opportunity to tell these stories in an anonymous way in order to challenge the stigma, silence, and misunderstandings around domestic violence.  I thought this would especially critical on an issue where breaking the silence is necessary for change, and often data visualizations on this issue other reflect on rates of violence rather than the women's stories.

As I parsed through their stories, I also realized this data would also help me explore the specific kinds of support that is missing and needed.  From their stories, it becomes clear that support for domestic violence survivors in this community is needed. For thesis, I will be designing a model of support with these 5 women to extend the Jahajee Sisters' existing support services.  However, first, we must together we must identify the specific needs as well as barriers to seeking support. This project has a created a tool for me to have this conversation with the women. 

My values around this project are making it survivor-centered as well as using their voices as a site of power and empowerment to prompt change.

**The Process**

My process was chaotic and begin with synthesizing stories through mind maps and affinity maps.  This allowed me to come up with the key moments and life events that influenced their decision to leave, which I mapped out on each survivor's timeline.

*Relationship Begins * Abuse Begins * Has a child * Uses support service * Job security * Abusive relationship end*

* Intial Concepts

   Visualizing athways out of abuse -> Mapping boundaries -> Looking at pathways and key moments over time
   
 I intially planned to map out moments when the women's boundaries where crossed.  Although I liked the concept, I did not find the visualization to be readable.  It also did not lead to new insights.  After my check-in with Joey, he was able to suggest using time as a variable, and therefore I created the timelines.

  **Reflection**
  
  The process of creating a dataset and being very structured about approaching their stories was super helpful.  While affinity mapping helped me identity key moments shared between the women, something about creating this visualization helped me narrow down the list to critical moments that influenced the women's decision-making.  In part, much of this happened, as I transitioned from going to a concept that was closer to a journey map to making timelines. 
  
The timelines I have allowed me to calculate average time between shared momemnts between the women.  While this may be reductive, it was super interesting to begin seeing these patterns, and I am looking forward to sharing this with the women and getting their insights around what the graphs says.
  
  Next steps: Figuring out how to make this interactive!
